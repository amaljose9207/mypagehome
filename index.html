<p1>Even though I work in Tech industry having experience with multi national IT companies, I dont code. Never been a developer in my career. 
I started as a system administrator fixing application issues, repairing computers and printers. Later moved into IT Operations Escalation Management 
followed by Customer Provisioning. I have some good understanding on the Business and Technical side of Cloud industry. I just turned 30 this year and suddenly seems having a feeling
inside my mind to start learning some real coding. This space is for that, My hobby and personal projects are maintained in the GitHub repository, links are given in the footer. </p1>
