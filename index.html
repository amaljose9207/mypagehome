<p1>Even though I work in Tech industry having experience with multi national IT companies, I dont code. Never been a developer in my career. 
I started as a system administratior fixing application issues, repairing computers and printers. Later moved into IT Operations Escalation Management 
followed by Customer Provisioning. I have a good understanding on the business and Technical side of Cloud industry. I just turned 30 this year and suddenly seems having a feeling
inside my mind to start learing some real coding. This space is for that. My hobby and personal projects are maintained in my person GitHub repository, links are in the footer. </p1>
