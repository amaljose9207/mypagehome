<p>Even though I work in Tech industry having experience with multi national IT companies, I dont code. Never been a developer in my career. 
I started as a system administratior fixing application issues, repairing computers and printers. Later moved into IT Operations Escalation Management 
followed by Customer Provisioning. I have a good understanding on the business and Technical side of Cloud industry. I just turned 30 this year and suddenly seems having a feeling
inside my mind to start learing some real coding. This space is for that. My hobby and personal projects are maintained  <a href="https://github.com/begin30code" target="_blank">
